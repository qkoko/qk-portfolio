My small Portfolio.

Stack:
- NextJs (at the time of writing, I haven't been using any of the cool features for server side rendering yet)
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- A little bit of SASS
- Framer Motion
- A little bit of Transition from HeadlessUI (cause why not)


Feel free to clone and run it with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
